The PoisFFT library solves the Poisson equation on a uniform Cartesian grid 
using the Fast Fourier Transform. It calls the library FFTW3 and (if MPI is used) 
also PFFT.

The description is available in article

Please cite this article when using the library for your research.


The Poisson equation used is

    \Delta \phi = b
 
 where `\phi` and `b` are functions of 1, 2 or 3 spatial dimensions.


 
 
 
 
For instruction how to use the API after installation see `usage_Fortran.txt`,
`usage_C.txt` and `usage_C++`.



For examples see `testpoisson.f90`, `testpoisson.c` and `testpoisson.cc`.






The installation is done using SConstruct, a Python based build environment, if you do not have it, you must install it first. 

For compiling the library use

    scons

or 

    scons mpi=yes

in the `src` directory.

For compiling of the test programs add `test` after the above command.

If you use other compilers than GCC (gfortran, gcc, g++), add argument comp, i.e.,

    scons comp=intel

or

    scons comp=sun

For other compilers you will have to add the options in the `SConstruct` file.

If you want to disable OpenMP, use

    scons openmp=no

With MPI it is disabled automatically, but can be explicitly enabled by

    scons mpi=yes openmp=yes

for hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization.
